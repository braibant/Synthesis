- GCD -> MOD. 
- Turns out that to avoid having to use the scheduler, one may just
use "a orElse b" composition of actions, and "a ; b", and use wires to
implement sequential composition...

Provided core GAA with a formal 'monadic' semantics, with a mixture of
PHOAS, and dependent de Bruijn indices.

The user has to specify a schedule between the rules. A scheduler
cannot make a fair schedule between two rules that both apply. Or a
round robin ? 

04/19/2012 Meeting

- Investigate the use of PHOAS for the definition of the embedding of TRS. 
- Investigate the chapter of CPDT called Generic programming to
  discover if Coq inductives could be used instead of the deep-embedding
