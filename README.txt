This is the supplementary materials associated to the "Fe-Si : Formal
verification of hardware synthesis paper"

It contains two directories.  
- src contains the sources of the compiler
- examples contains the various examples discussed in the paper, as
well as the prototype OCaml back-end to verilog. 

Each of this directory contains a README file with more informations. 

Running [make] builds the whole development. In the examples
directory, running [make demo] generates examples cores.
